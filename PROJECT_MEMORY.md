## 1. Project Status

_Current phase, headline goal of the current sprint, and what counts as "done"
for the active milestone. The owner updates this after each strategy session._

- **Current phase:** _TODO — fill in after the next strategy session._
- **Active milestone:** _TODO._
- **Definition of done for this milestone:** _TODO._

---

## 2. Recent Decisions

_Last 5 major decisions, dated `YYYY-MM-DD`. New entries go on top; trim the
list to 5 when a sixth is added. Capture the decision, the rationale in one
line, and whether it has been encoded in the repo (commit / config / doc)._

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Encoded in |
|---|---|---|---|
| _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ | _TODO_ |

---

## 3. Active TODOs

_Cross-PR running list of things the owner has agreed to do, things waiting on
external data, and things explicitly deferred. One bullet per item with the
owner ("@owner" / "@claude-code") and a one-line status._

- _TODO — first entry pending._

## 4. Data Acquisition Progress

## 5. Calibration Progress

_Per archetype × month grid status for the 12 public archetypes + annual
status for the 2 residential archetypes. Cell values: `–` (not run),
`pending` (run but NMBE not yet within target), `pass` (within target).
The target thresholds are public ±10 % monthly, residential ±20 % annual._

## 6. Open Questions

_Anything Claude Code surfaced that the owner has not yet answered. Each
question stays here until it is resolved by the owner via claude.ai, after
which it migrates to §2 Recent Decisions as a row._

- _TODO — no open questions yet._
